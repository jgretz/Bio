Work
-----------
As the CTO at Truefit, Josh helps our talented team explore new areas, expand their skills, and imagine creative approaches to creating software people love. Since 2003, Josh has brought his passion for solving problems with technology to Truefit and its clients. He is a passionate explorer of the cutting edge for both technology and business. He understands the challenges in getting new tech products to market and works with our clients and our team to develop innovative ways of overcoming them.

Josh graduated from Grove City College in 2004 with a B.S. in Computer Information Systems and a minor in business. You can still find him around campus, advising students and teaching a class as an adjunct professor.

Giving back to the community is a huge part of Josh’s life. In addition to contributing to open source, Josh has presented talks at conferences like CodeMash, ThatConference, StirTrek and PGH Tech Fest. Josh also makes time to volunteer as an adult leader of his church’s youth group. Whether its wrestling code into submission or helping to shape the bright minds of the future, Josh is committed to leaving the world a little bit better than he found it.

Josh resides in Cranberry Township with his wife, three sons, and their labradoodle. He can normally be found wearing shorts (even in December) in front of a computer delving into some new experiment. When he’s not being beguiled by code, you can find him playing basketball, watching any sport known to man (seriously, he stays up late to watch Olympic Handball), or creating some tasty morsel in the kitchen.
